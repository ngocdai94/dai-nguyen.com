    <h2>Why Ubiquiti Network?</h2>
    <p>
        Enterprise Networking Products are the networking products built for business. They are all certified and
        passed
        all the required tests (usually much more extreme tests than home consumming networking products) before
        getting out to the market.
    </p>

    <p>
        Enterprise Networking products are always built for Security, Performance, 24/7 Workload. A standard Enterprise
        Networking system usually has a Security Gateway, an Ethernet Switch, and serveral Access Points.
    </p>

    <p>
        For these reasons, the Enterprise Networking products are very expensive. For example, a standard networking
        system provided by <b>Cisco</b> usually costs more than <strong>$1,000 USD.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        However, there is a company selling the same Enterprise Networking products with much afforadble price than <b>Cisco</b>,
        which is <b>UBNT (Ubiquiti Networks)</b>. Their standard networking system usually cost around <strong>$600
            USD.</strong>
