    <p>My name is Dai Nguyen. I am pursuing <strong>Web Development and Network Administration</strong> certificate programs at <strong>Seattle Central College</strong>, and this is my second quarter here. So far, I really like the programs since they help me to understand how the Internet and Website work together.</p>

    <p>Besides school, I love reading, playing tennis, and hanging out with my friends. I also love doing jobs related to Computer Networks. Recently, I helped a client to design and built a secured Wireless and Network solution for their home. Furthermore, I helped them to install and setup PoE cameras, which were a great opportunity for me to get hands-on what I have learned from classes.</p>

    <p>As the technologies is growing rapidly, it is very challenging to catch up all of them. Sometimes, it is very frustrated to me when learning something new but not understanding them at all. However, I am very positive and hard-working person. Therefore, I will strive to overcome those challenges.</p>
