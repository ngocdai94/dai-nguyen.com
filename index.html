The processor on the PC was Intel Pentium II, and it had Windows 98 OS installed on it. Fascinating, the PC used a big and heavy cathode-ray-tube (CRT) monitor, and it also had Flobby Disks which were very popular back then.<p><p>At that time, none of us knew how to assemble the PC. Therefore, we had to wait for a technician to come in and assemble it. When he came and finished assembling it, he showed us how to use it. In the end, he showed me how to open a racing game to play since the game was pre-installed on the hard drive.</p><p>The moment when I started playing the game, I was amazed by how the computer could do that. Since then, my passion and ambition started heading toward to Electronics & Computer field, and I have been taking a lot of classes regarding about Electrical/Electronics, Computer Systems, Computer Networks, and Programming to better understand about the computer.</p></div></div><div class="profileSection"><figure><img src="imgs/profile.jpg" class="profilePhoto" alt="profile photo"></figure></div><div class="infoTable"><h2>Genernal Information</h2><div class="tableRow"><div class="tableCell_1">Address</div><div class="tableCell_2">Burien, WA 98166, USA</div></div><div class="tableRow"><div class="tableCell_1">Email</div><div class="tableCell_2"><span class="infoMail"><a href="mailto:hello@dai-nguyen.com">hello@dai-nguyen.com</a></span></div></div></div><div class="socialNetwork"><nav><a href="http://linkedin.dai-nguyen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-3x"></i></a><a href="http://github.dai-nguyen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fab fa-github fa-3x"></i></a><a href="http://fb.dai-nguyen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fab fa-facebook fa-3x"></i></a><a href="http://ig.dai-nguyen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fab fa-instagram fa-3x"></i></a><a href="http://tw.dai-nguyen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-3x"></i></a></nav></div></section><section class="experience"><h2>Relevant Experience</h2><ul><li><h3>June 2017 - August 2017</h3><h4>Seattle University</h4><h5>Undergraduate Research Assistant</h5><p>Provideded ongoing assistance to an assigned faculty member, and handled various responsibilities related to research projects and miscellaneous assignments</p></li><li><h3>March 2017 - June 2017</h3><h4>Seattle City Light</h4><h5>Electrical Engineering Intern</h5><p>Designed, tested, and developed a prototype for a DC distribution circuit to charge a cellphone, using 6VDC alkaline battery and 5V USB charger</p></li><li><h3>January 2017 - March 2017</h3><h4>Seattle University</h4><h5>Teaching Assistant</h5><p>Provided ongoing assistance to laboratory students, specifically with developing and comprehending programming projects using VHDL to FPGA</p></li></ul></section><section class="education"><h2>Education</h2><ul><li><h3>2015 - 2018</h3><h4>Seattle University</h4><h5>B.S. in Electrical Engineering</h5><br></li><li><h3>2013 - 2015</h2><h4>Seattle Central College</h3><h5>A.S. in Electrical and Computer Science</h4></li></ul></section><section class="reference"><h2>References</h2><i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i><p>I had the pleasure of studying with Dai when we were in school together. An incredibly gifted student, Dai was always meticulously organized. His notes were immaculate, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that his breadboards looked like works of art. Dai is dedicated, the type of person who will spend an extra hour to take a project from 98% perfect to 100%. He is extremely smart, focused, and driven. In group projects, he was the quiet backbone of the team. You can tell by talking with him that he has a genuine passion for software and electronics. He would make a great addition to any software or hardware team. Finally, I would like to add that Dai did not request that I write this recommendation. I just saw his profile and wanted to write one because he is that good.</p><h3>Mirka Mandich</h3><h4>Electrical Engineer at Seattle University</h4><h5>Seattle University Class of 2019</h5><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dai-nguyen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Original recommendation on LinkedIn</a></section><div class="contactMe"><a href="contactme.php">CONTACT ME</a></div></main><footer>&copy; 2018 - <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear());</script> by Dai Nguyen, All Rights Reserved<br><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="border:0;width:88px;height:26px;margin-top:10px;"src="imgs/valid_html.png" alt="Valid HTML!"/></a> <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=dai-nguyen.com&profile=css3svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="border:0;width:95px;height:26px" src="imgs/valid_css.svg"alt="Valid CSS!"/></a></footer></div><script>window.onload=function(){var el_moreAboutMeButton=document.getElementById("moreAboutMeButton");el_moreAboutMeButton.style.display="block";}
